  ## Description

  This program is designed to guide the user through a series of prompts, in order to add content to their readme file which the program will automatically generate for them.

  ## Installation

  1. The user must download all necessary files from my repository, and they must be aable to execute the index.js file through a command line. I used git bash. 2. They must install node.js. 3. They must do an npm install of the required dependencies, namely "inquirer". 4. All files from my repository must remain in the local folder where they are executing index.js

  ## Usage

  The user would find this program of value for easily creating a ReadMe file. Instead of considering all of the content and components they want to create i.e badges, they can simply answer a series of questions and have the program consolidate their answers and generate a clean, clear, complete, and easy to read ReadMe file.

  ## Licensing

  No licensing is required. The user is free to use and modify this as they desire.
